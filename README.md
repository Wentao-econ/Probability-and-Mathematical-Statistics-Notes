# Probability-and-Mathematical-Statistics-Notes
This repository contains my notes of Probability and Mathematical Statistics. The content reaches the graduate level but also perfectly suits a first-year undergraduate student.

Even though there are countless introductory textbooks on probability theory and mathematical statistics, I noticed that three particularly perplexing points—which halted my own learning and required deep reflection—are seldom emphasized in these materials. My notes provide detailed explanations and discussions on each of these points:

1. **What exactly is “probability”?** Is it the “truth only known to God” as frequentists describe it (the ratio of universes where the event occurs to the total number of parallel universes), or is it a “subjective belief” as Bayesians argue? Does true randomness exist in the world? And if the world is deterministic, how would that affect these two interpretations of probability?

2. **What is a random variable truly?** How can we understand that it is merely a mathematical model—that by introducing a random variable into a problem, we are actually building a model? If the definition of a random variable relies on the concept of a random experiment, why is it unnecessary to explicitly state the corresponding random experiment every time we introduce a random variable?

3. **How should we interpret the statement that “the population is unknown/unobservable”?** Instructors might give examples such as testing a batch of parts for defects, where full inspection is impossible because inspection damages the parts. Yet one could immediately think of counterexamples where the entire population can be observed—for instance, the heights of all female students in a school. Clearly, statisticians have thought deeply about this issue, as most of them adopt the elegant concept of a Data Generating Process (DGP) instead of relying solely on the word “population.”

These notes are still being updated on an irregular basis, primarily to supplement each chapter with high-quality exercises, refine certain details in the main text, and correct any typos or errors. (Currently, this set of notes is only available in Chinese; an English version will be uploaded within the next year.)
